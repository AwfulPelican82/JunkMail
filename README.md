Sends any amount of emails to a specified email address. 


Notice:

1.) Please type in the full handle (example@domain.com, NOT example)

2.) Do not use Gmail to send the emails from. Your login request won't go through properly

3.) You can send any amount of emails, but at around 20 you may be locked out from sending emails to that address. 

That is not a problem with the code, rather a security measure implemented by email providers.

4.) Sometimes the message will not appear, only the subject. This will be fixed soon.

5.) You can run this code on most browser-based IDE, like Replit.
